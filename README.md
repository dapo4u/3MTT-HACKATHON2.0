🎉 Welcome to the CLICK2VOTE TEAM Repository!
🌟 Empowering Seamless, Secure, and Efficient Voting Solutions

We are the CLICK2VOTE TEAM, proud participants in the 3MTT Hackathon 2.0! Our flagship creation, the Click2Vote App, is a game-changing innovation designed to ensure:

✅ Seamless Voting
✅ Efficient Processes
✅ Secure Elections
✅ Cost-Effective Solutions
🛠️ Problem the Click2Vote App Solves
The Click2Vote App is a highly SECURED Django-based electronic voting platform designed to tackle critical issues in Nigeria's electoral process, such as:

🛡️ Eliminating Ballot Snatching
🛡️ Preventing Manipulation and Rigging (especially at Local Government Areas)
🕒 Removing Unnecessary Delays in the declaration of results
Fun Fact: This app reflects real-world insights, as one of our team members is an Adhoc INEC officer with first-hand knowledge of these challenges.

🗳️ About the Click2Vote App
The app performs seamlessly on Linux-based systems, such as Ubuntu and Kali Linux.

🖥️ Linux: No errors detected during testing.
💻 Windows: Some errors may occur due to missing GTK runtime and DLL files, especially on older versions like Windows 7.
🛠️ We resolved these issues using MSYS2 and successfully ran the app on Windows 10.
🎥 A video tutorial on fixing these errors is coming soon!
