🌟 Empowering Seamless, Secure, and Cost-Effective Voting Solutions

We are the CLICK2VOTE TEAM, proud participants in the 3MTT Hackathon 2.0! We developed several innovative apps during the event, but the standout is our  

🎉 Click2Vote App
This app ensures seamless, efficient, secure, and cost-effective voting, solving critical problems in the electoral process in NIgeria .

🛠️ Problem the Click2Vote App Solves
The Click2Vote App is a highly secure Django-based electronic voting platform designed to address several key problems  in Nigerian elections:

🗳️ Ballot Snatching
🛡️ Election Manipulation and Rigging (especially at the LGAs in Nigeria)
⏳ Unnecessary Delays in the declaration of results
As an Adhoc INEC officer, I can personally attest to how election rigging starts at the local government level.

🗳️ About the Click2Vote App
The Click2Vote App works smoothly on Linux and Ubuntu laptops, but there are a few errors when running the app  on Windows systems:

🖥️ Linux: No errors detected during testing on Kali Linux and Ubuntu.
💻 Windows: Errors may occur due to missing GTK runtime and DLL files (especially on Windows 7).
Solution: I used MSYS2 to resolve these issues and ran the app successfully on Windows 10.
Note: The issue is not with the app itself, but rather with Windows not having the necessary dependencies.
🎥 Watch our upcoming video tutorial on how to fix the error on Windows!
