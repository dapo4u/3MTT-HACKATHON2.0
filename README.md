🚀 CLICK2VOTE TEAM
🌟 Building Seamless, Secure, and Cost-Effective Voting Solutions

We are the CLICK2VOTE TEAM, proud participants in the 3MTT Hackathon 2.0! Throughout the event, we developed multiple apps, but the standout is our flagship project:
The Click2Vote App, which ensures seamless, efficient, secure, and cost-effective voting.

🛠️ Problem the App Solves
The Click2Vote App is a highly secure Django-based electronic voting system that addresses the following critical issues in Nigerian elections:

🗳️ Ballot Snatching
🛡️ Election Manipulation and Rigging (particularly at the LGAs in Nigeria)
⏳ Unnecessary Delays in declaring results
As an Adhoc INEC officer, I can personally attest to how rigging begins at the local government level.

🗳️ About the Click2Vote App
The Click2Vote App works smoothly on Linux and Ubuntu laptops without errors, but there are potential issues when running it on Windows systems.

🖥️ Linux: Tested on Kali Linux, no errors found.
💻 Windows: Errors may occur due to missing GTK runtime and required DLL files (especially on Windows 7). However, the issue can be fixed using MSYS2, and we successfully ran the app on Windows 10 for the Hackathon submission.
Note: This issue is not due to the app but rather Windows' limitations with necessary dependencies.
🎥 A detailed video tutorial on fixing the error will be posted soon!
